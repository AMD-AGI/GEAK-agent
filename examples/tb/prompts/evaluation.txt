Task:
Evaluate the following Triton kernel on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0 for each of the listed criteria. 
For each criteria you must provide:
* A score (float between 0.0 (worst) and 1.0 (best))
* A brief justification (1–2 lines)
* Actionable suggestions, if any

Evaluation Criteria:
1. Fusion Intelligence: Does the kernel smartly fuse compatible operations to reduce memory I/O and kernel launches?
2. Autotuning Coverage: Does it use `@triton.autotune`? Are the tuning ranges meaningful, diverse, and AMD MI300 GPU hardware-appropriate? (Assign 0.0 if no autotuning config is present.)
3. Memory Access Efficiency: Does it optimize memory layout, coalesced access, and reduce redundant reads/writes?
4. Algorithmic complexity: Does it fuse multiple for-loops in one smartly? Are there redundant nested for-loops?
5. Warp/Wavefront Utilization: Does it use thread blocks that fully utilize compute units on the target GPU (e.g., MI300X)?
6. Software pipelining: Does it explore good enough range for num_stages? Valid range for MI300 GPU is [1,16]. For invalid values assign score of 0.0.
7. Numerical Stability: Is it numerically safe for large input ranges (e.g., uses max-subtraction in softmax, clamps, etc.)?
8. Correctness and Portability: Does the kernel handle edge cases (e.g., sizes not divisible by block size)? Is it portable across Triton-supported devices?
9. Optimization scope: Is the given kernel missing techniques from well-known optimizations methods? e.g. softmax kernel vs online softmax vs fused softmax. If the kernel is already most optimal then assign a score of 1.0.

Evaluate the following Triton kernel using the criteria above:
```python
{current_program}
```
